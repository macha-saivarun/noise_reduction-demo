# Noise Reduction Demo

This OpenCV project demonstrates image noise reduction techniques using interactive trackbars for filter type and kernel size.

## ðŸ§° Features
- Switch between Average, Gaussian, and Median blur.
- Control kernel size interactively.
- Compare filter effects in real-time.

## ðŸ“¸ Preview
> Works on any noisy image. Replace `noisy_image.jpg` with your own.

## ðŸš€ Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
